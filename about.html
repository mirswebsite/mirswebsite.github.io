			<p>When in New York City, the best way to get the feel of the Big Apple is to visit Times Square. Surrounding yourself within the tall buildings, led lights, and the crowd- that is what Times Square is known for. It’s a perfect place to shop at major retail stores and then whine down at a restaurant. After that one can head towards the red stairs for a picture perfect moment.  
			During the New Year, Times Square has its infamous Ball Drop with thousands of people gathered around the world to ring in the New Year.
